# Smart Vision Technology Quality Control

Welcome to the **Smart Vision Technology Quality Control** project! This repository contains a comprehensive solution for quality control in food products using advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. The project leverages various technologies and frameworks to provide a robust and user-friendly application.


## Features

- **Image Analysis**: Upload images for analysis to detect various attributes of food products.
- **OCR Capabilities**: Extract text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
- **Freshness Detection**: Assess the freshness of food items based on visual cues.
- **MRP and Expiry Detection**: Identify the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) and expiry dates from product packaging.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern UI.

## UI Design

The UI is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, featuring:

- **Home Page**: A welcoming interface for users to upload images.

- **Analysis Page**: Displays the results of the image analysis, including detected text, freshness status, and other relevant information.

## System Design

The system is designed to handle image uploads, process them through various machine learning models, and return analysis results. The architecture consists of:

- **Frontend**: Built with Next.js, it provides a user interface for uploading images and displaying results.
- **Backend**: A Flask/FastAPI server that handles image processing requests and communicates with machine learning models.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Various models for OCR, freshness detection, MRP and expiry detection, and item counting.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Python (v3.8 or later)
- pip (Python package manager)
- conda (for managing Python environments)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Smart-Vision-Technology-Quality-Control-.git
   cd Smart-Vision-Technology-Quality-Control-
   ```

2. **Set up the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd web-app
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   conda create -p venv python==3.8
   conda activate venv
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the development server**:
   - For the frontend:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - For the backend:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

5. **Open your browser** and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.
